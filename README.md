I ran the TGS_salt-2 on google colab.

You will need kaggle api installed in colab or your local machine for this.

Instructions on installing kaggle api in colab and setup can be found here:

In TGS_salt-2, the first few blocks are for kaggle api installation and downloading the dataset from kaggle(all have been commented properly).

Other requirements:
1. keras
2. sklearn
3. pandas
4. numpy
5. matplotlib
6. tqdm
7. tensorflow

Python 3.6 was used.
