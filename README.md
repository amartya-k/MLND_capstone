## TGS Salt Identification Challenge(Kaggle)
### Project Goal: The goal is to segment regions that contain salt using seismic data

The main filename is TGS_salt-Identification-main.ipynb

I ran the TGS_salt-Identification-main.ipynb on google colab.

You will need kaggle api installed in colab or your local machine for this.

Instructions on installing kaggle api in colab and setup can be found here:

In TGS_salt-Identification-main.ipynb, the first few blocks are for kaggle api installation and downloading the dataset from kaggle(all have been commented properly).
